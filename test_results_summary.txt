To view the detailed test results, open the file test_results.trx in a test result viewer (such as Visual Studio, Azure DevOps, or an online TRX viewer).

To quickly see a summary in the terminal, you can run:

  dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=normal"

Or, to extract a summary from the .trx file, use:

  grep -E "<UnitTestResult" test_results.trx | grep outcome

This will show the outcome (Passed/Failed) for each test.
